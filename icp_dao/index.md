#### How unique are SNS DAOs in Web3?

ICP is unique in that it can host fully-on chain dapps (frontend, backend application logic, and data), **so SNS DAOs are unique in that they can fully control (via voting) every aspect of a dapp, since everything is on-chain.**

Having fully on-chain DAOs is important because it enables all decisions to be executed on the blockchain. **This is in contrast to existing DAOs on other blockchains where voting takes place on-chain but the execution of the results are often carried out by developers off-chain. This facilitates true decentralization.**

#### What are the advantages of SNS DAOs?

1. **Community Engagement**: as co-owners of the product, **users become core contributors, developers deliver on value proposition.**
2. **Speedy User Adoption**: As co-owners, users become the biggest advocates of the product.
3. Funding: **projects are funded through a community-driven** decentralization sale.
