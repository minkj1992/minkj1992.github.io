The `Book of Proverbs` (Hebrew: מִשְלֵי, Mīšlē, "`Proverbs of Solomon`") is a book in the third section (called Ketuvim) of the Hebrew Bible.

{{< admonition tip "Tanakh, Hebrew Bible" >}}
_Book of Proverbs는 타나크(히브리어 성경)안에 들어 있으며, 기원전 1500~400년대 바빌로니아, 팔레스티나, 이집트 등의 지역에서 전해지던 이야기들이 기록된 경전들이 오랜 세월을 거쳐 한권의 책으로 만들어져 전해져 왔다._

또한 타나크는 아래의 4종교의 경전으로도 인정되어
1. 유대교
2. 카톨릭
3. 기독교
4. 이슬람교

학계에서는 중립적으로 `히브리 성경`이라는 단어를 사용하기도 한다.
{{< /admonition  >}}

Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium.

Although most of this book identifies **Solomon as its author**, not all of it is attributed to him. This book itself also emphasizes that this book is a **collection of proverbs of many people**.


{{< admonition tip "31장으로 구성된 이유" >}}
_Book of Proverbs는 의도적으로 31장으로 구성되어있다라고 보는 학자들도 있는데, 이유는 매일 1장씩 읽기 편하도록 히스기야 시대에 신하들이 편찬했다는 주장이다. 이 주장을 굳이 믿지 않더라도, 실제로 일자별로 읽어보니 아침을 좀 더 고요하게 마음으로 맞이할 수 있었던 것 같다._
