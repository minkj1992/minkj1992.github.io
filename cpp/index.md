> `Carbon` vs C++
1. [Generics](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/design/generics/overview.md#what-are-generics)
2. Memory Safety

> [Carbon's Principles](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/principles/README.md)

1. Errors are values: recoverable
2. Information accumulation: with forward declarations used to introduce names beforethey are first referenced when necessary.
3. Low context sensitivity: 코드를 읽고 이해하는 데 필요한 컨텍스트의 양을 충분히 효과적으로 줄이기 위해쓰기뿐만 아니라 읽기에도 이점이 있는 간결함을 기꺼이 희생하겠다.
4. Prefer providing only one way to do a given thing
5. Safety strategy
  1. Memory safety
  2. Type safety
  3. Data race safety
6. One static open extennsion mechanism
7. Success criteria

> Difficulties improving C++

1. Carbon team failed to meaningfully change C++'s direction and priorities towards improvements rather than backwards compatibility, and demonstrates how the process can fail to make directional decisions.
2. C++'s process is oriented around standardization rather than design



## 5. Keywords
